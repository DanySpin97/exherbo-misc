SUMMARY="eAccelerator is a further development of the mmcache PHP accelerator and encoder."
DESCRIPTION="
eAccelerator is a free open-source PHP accelerator & optimizer. It increases the performance of PHP
scripts by caching them in their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost
completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution. eAccelerator typically
reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.
