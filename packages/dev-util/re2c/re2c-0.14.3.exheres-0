SUMMARY="Re2c Scanner Generator"
DESCRIPTION="
re2c is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners. Unlike any other such tool, re2c focuses on generating high efficient code for regular expression matching. As a result this allows a much broader range of use than any traditional lexer offers. And Last but not least re2c generates warning free code that is equal to hand-written code in terms of size, speed and quality.
