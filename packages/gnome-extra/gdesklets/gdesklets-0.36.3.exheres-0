SUMMARY="gDesklets - GNOME Desktop Applets"
DESCRIPTION="
gDesklets is a system for bringing mini programs (desklets),
such as weather forecasts, news tickers, system information displays,
or music player controls, onto your desktop, where they are
sitting there in a symbiotic relationship of eye candy and usefulness.
The possibilities are really endless and they are always there to serve
you whenever you need them, just one key-press away. The system is not
restricted to one desktop environment, but currently works on most of
the modern Unix desktops (including GNOME, KDE, Xfce).
