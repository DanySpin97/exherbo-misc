SUMMARY="GUPnP is an object-oriented open source framework
for creating UPnP devices and control points, written in C
using GObject and libsoup. The GUPnP API is intended to be
easy to use, efficient and flexible. It provides the same
set of features as libupnp, but shields the developer from
most of UPnP's internals."
DESCRIPTION="
The GUPnP framework consists of the following libraries:

  * GSSDP implements resource discovery and announcement over SSDP.

  * GUPnP implements the UPnP specification: resource announcement and discovery, description,
    control, event notification, and presentation (GUPnP includes basic web server functionality
    through libsoup). GUPnP does not include helpers for construction or control of specific
    standardized resources (e.g. MediaServer); this is left for higher level libraries utilizing
    the GUPnP framework.
  
  * GUPnP-AV is a collection of helpers for building AV (audio/video) applications using GUPnP.

  * GUPnP-DLNA is a small utility library that aims to ease the DLNA-related tasks such as media
    profile guessing, transcoding to a given profile, etc. 

GUPnP is free software released under the GNU LGPL.
